# Neural Networks 

A neural network (NN) is a set of layers made of small nodes (or neurons) that perform mathematical operations to detect patterns in data. NN algorithms try to mimic how human neurons work. 

### Key terms
1. Neuron or node, perceptron, unit: basic building block of a NN. It takes weighted values, performs mathematical calculation and produce output
2. Deep Neural Network (DNN): a NN with many hidden layers 
3. Weights: a value that explains the importance of the connection between any two neurons
4. Bias: a costant value added to the sum of the product between input values and respective weights.
5. Activation function: a function that is applied to the output of a neuron, allows the network to laern more complex patterns. It takes the weighted sum of the inputs to the neuron and applies a non-linear transformation to the result. The output of the function is then passed as input to the next layer in the NN.
