# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

It's a tool for dimensionality reduction, and it's often used when we use a lot of features and want to reduce the training time needed.

What it does: it reduces the features, while trying to lose as few informations as possible.

When not to use it: when working with Euclidean distance-based algorithm
